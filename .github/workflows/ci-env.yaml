name: CI-environment-variables
# This tests whether environment variables are loaded correctly within the
# Docker container. The example sets the COMPOSER_PROCESS_TIMEOUT variable
# (which has a default of 300), and changes the command to "config" with args
# "process-timeout", which will show the value of the associated config setting.defaults:
# If the environment variables are loaded, the script should output 1. If they
# are ignored, it should output 300.
